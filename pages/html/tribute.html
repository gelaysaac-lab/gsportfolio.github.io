            <p>Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics (alongside quantum mechanics).</p>
            <p>His massâ€“energy equivalence formula E = mc^2 has been dubbed "the world's most famous equation".</p>
            <p>Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for his work on theoretical physics, especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect, a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory.</p>
            <p>Throughout his life, Einstein published hundreds of scientific papers and books. He is widely regarded as one of the most influential physicists of the 20th century.</p>
